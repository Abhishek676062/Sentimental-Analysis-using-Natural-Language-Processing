# Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing on Tweet Data

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on tweet data. The project aims to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the sentiment analysis model is included in this repository. However, The dataset should be in a CSV format with two columns: "text" containing the tweet text and "label" containing the corresponding sentiment label.

# Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
```
Python 
NLTK 
scikit-learn 
Pandas 
NumPy
```

You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

# Preprocessing

The tweet data needs to be preprocessed before training the sentiment analysis model. The preprocessing steps include tokenization, removal of stopwords, stemming or lemmatization, and vectorization of text data.

# Model Training

To train the sentiment analysis model, follow these steps:

Download the dataset from source and place it in the data/ directory.

Adjust the configuration parameters in the config.py file, such as the dataset path, preprocessing options, and model selection.

Run the **Sentimental Analysis using Natural Language Processing.ipynb** script to preprocess the data and train the sentiment analysis model:
```
python Sentimental Analysis using Natural Language Processing.ipynb
```
After training, the trained model will be saved in the saved_models/ directory.

# Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model, the accuracy and other relevant metrics can be calculated. The evaluation results will be displayed in the console.

# Prediction

To make sentiment predictions on new tweet data, follow these steps:

Place the tweet data in a CSV file with a "text" column containing the tweet text.

Adjust the configuration parameters in the config.py file, such as the path to the saved model and preprocessing options.

Run the **Untitled.ipynb** script to load the trained model and generate predictions for the tweet data:
```
python Untitled.ipynb
```
The predictions will be saved in a CSV file with an additional "label" column indicating the predicted sentiment.
